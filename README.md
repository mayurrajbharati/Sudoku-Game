# Sudoku-Game
This C++ program implements a Sudoku Game which was our Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) Lab project.
This game has 3 difficulty modes, which enables the user to give input to a pre-existing Sudoku board,along with a Sandbox Mode, which allows the user to customize the entire Sudoku board. 
We are still working to bring more subtle changes to the interface as well as the gameplay.
Feel free to suggest any changes.
